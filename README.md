**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Minimum Viable Product that demonstrates the effectiveness of the Cluster Monitoring Solution to help the LCA team meet their business needs. Utilized Docker and PostgreSQL to monitor and record system hardware specifications as well as resource usage.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Java Implementation of a Stock Quote app that finds stock information in real time and stores it in a SQL database. Utilized JDBC and OkHttp libraries to communicate with RDBMS and Alpha Vantage Rapid API in Java as well as Jackson library to parse JSON stock quote responses.
  - Grep App: Java implementation of the widely used Linux grep feature for non-Linux users. Made in Intellij utilizing Docker and Java to find specified keywords within all files of a specified directory and prints them in an output file in a specified location.
